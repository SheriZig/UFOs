# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis:
Dana is a Data Journalist, and she has accepted an assignment to write an article about her hometown of McMinnville, OR. The town is known for UFO sightings. So this is the topic that she has chosen as the focus of her article. She is starting the project with just a JavaScript file containing information relating to UFO sightings though out the world. For this assignment she wants to create a “really cool, interactive dashboard”. The site will consist of the article, a table containing the UFO data and filters to allow the users to filter the data table to their area of interest. 

## Results: 
A site was created that contains the following elements: 
-	Site title
-	Article title
-	Article
-	Table of UFO data 
-	Five options to filter the data (Date, City, State, Country, Shape)
