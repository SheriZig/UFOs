# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis:
Dana is a Data Journalist, and she has accepted an assignment to write an article about her hometown of McMinnville, OR. The town is known for UFO sightings. So this is the topic that she has chosen as the focus of her article. She is starting the project with just a JavaScript file containing information relating to UFO sightings though out the world. For this assignment she wants to create a “really cool, interactive dashboard”. The site will consist of the article, a table containing the UFO data and filters to allow the users to filter the data table to their area of interest. 

## Results: 
A site was created that contains the following elements: 
-	Site title
-	Article title
-	Article
-	Table of UFO data 
-	Five options to filter the data (Date, City, State, Country, Shape)

During the initial load of the site, all the data from the UFO sightings data table is displayed. The filters may be applied with multiple criteria or one at a time. 
The below example is filtering only on the day. Notice that the date is added to the filter. When the user presses the ‘Enter’ key on the keyboard the data is filtered based on the date selected.

In addition to the date, a selection for a specific date can also be entered. Notice that there is a placeholder in the field that indicates that the filter will accept a two-character state abbreviation. If ‘nj’ is added to the field, the data table will be filtered by the date entered as well as for the state of ‘nj’
